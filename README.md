# Valgrind script

### __What is it?__
It's a script for running valgrind inside a docker image, mainly for macOS because of the lack of support for the macOS Mojave. 

### __Requirements__
For this you need to download docker and create an image. You can use the instructions listed [here](https://www.gungorbudak.com/blog/2018/06/13/memory-leak-testing-with-valgrind-on-macos-using-docker-containers/).
I advise you to use the dockerfile I created, because it has some additional stuff for this script to work properly.
